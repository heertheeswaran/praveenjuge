title: "Down to 8 Apps on My Phone"
description: "It's been a year since I read Cal Newport's Digital Minimalism, he talks about taking back control of your time and to not feel like you need your phone attached to you all the time. Here are some changes I made and some changes I am still working on in my life."

The major takeaway for me was his call to join the attention resistance movement.

I, like most people, have no self control to read a book if I have the opportunity to watch Netflix. So I use the following techniques to trick my brain into doing what I want even when I don't want it.

## Set purpose for each device

**Phone:**

- Talking, Messaging to Friends
- Listening to Music and Podcasts
- Manage Todo List

**iPad:**

- Netflix, Music, Podcasts
- Reading Books

**MacBook:**

- Work (Design, Develop, Meetings, Mail)
- Music
- Browsing
- Video Editing
- Manage Todo List, Notes

**PC:**

- Gaming

## Remove all the other unneeded apps

After I set the main purpose for each device, I got into removing all the other cruft apps that I didn't need.

### Phone

I ended up with total of 8 essential apps on my phone. I have rooted my phone, so I could remove Play Store and other unneeded apps. I installed third party apps with APK from trusted sources which I manually update once a month.

### iPad

iPad is my main entertainment device, but most of this occurs in the browser. I haven't found the need to install any apps that are already available in the browser.

### MacBook

As my work device, it has everything I need to get into the flow, attend meetings and collaborate with coworkers.

## Reduce screen time

Already my screen time has reduced a lot, but there are some more steps I followed:

- Turn off all notifications other than the ringer and alarm.
- Leave phone and iPad on set places away from work and bed.
- Consolidate texting.
- Set leisure activities in the real world.

## Where I can improve on

As I gain time from other reducing other apps, I seem to spend even more time on Video Games. This might be due to the quarantine but I am spending a lot of time on it now.

I also observed I seem to be happy after playing games for 30 mins to an hour. And miserable if I play for more than 4 hours a day.

So that's my next target, play games for an hour a day and then move on to the next thing.

## Next Steps

Here are some steps that Cal Newport suggests that I intend to do more of:

- Be bored on purpose
- Be alone with my thoughts
- Embrace slow media
- Take long walks
- Let go of the fear of missing out
